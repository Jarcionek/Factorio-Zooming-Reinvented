# Factorio-Zooming-Reinvented
Factorio mod that improves zooming controls


# Description

This mod allows to heavily customise the zooming behaviour, in particular it allows to:
* change how far you can zoom out (and still see the world)
* change how aggressive the zooming is (equivalent to changing mouse wheel sensitivity)
* change at what position and zoom level the map opens
* zoom in or out instantly with a single key stroke


# Changelog

### 1.0.0 (pending)
* Initial release.
