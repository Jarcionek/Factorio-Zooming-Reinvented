Version: 1.2.0
Date: 06/04/2019
  Changes:
    - Binoculars zoom level is now configurable.
    - Added a Binoculars double-action setting. When enabled, first use will zoom in only enough to show map labels and second use will zoom in to the configured zoom level.
  Bugfixes:
    - If 'map zoom out after map move' is disabled, it is no longer possible to zoom out from the 'zoom to world' view to the map view.
    - 'Quick zoom out' does no longer reset last known map position.
  Minor improvements:
    - Changed thumbnail background colour.

Version: 1.1.0
Date: 06/04/2019
  Changes:
    - Added a Binoculars item that opens a map in the 'zoom to world' view at given position. Can be used from the map view to zoom in quickly. Although it behaves like an artillery remote (including that it can only be used within the artillery range), don't worry - artillery will not fire at that location.
    - Added new thumbnail.
