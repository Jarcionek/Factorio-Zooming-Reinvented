[mod-setting-description]
ZoomingReinvented_zoom-sensitivity=Defines how big is the change when zooming in or out. Doesn't apply to zooming in on the map (unless in zoom to world view). Base game's value is about 1.1 when the map is closed and about 1.25 when the map is open (regardless of whether it is in a zoom to world view or in a map view).
ZoomingReinvented_max-world-zoom-out=Defines how far you can zoom out and still see the world. In player view it defines maximum zoom out, in map it defines when zoom to world view switches back to map view. Base game's value is about 0.4.
ZoomingReinvented_default-map-zoom-level=Defines at what zoom level the map opens. Base game's value is about 0.0313.
ZoomingReinvented_quick-zoom-out-zoom-level=Defines at what zoom level the map opens when using 'Quick zoom out'.
ZoomingReinvented_disable-map-zoom-out=Defines whether to disable map zooming out after the map position has changed (by dragging, using move controls or zooming in). This to prevent sudden map position changes when zooming out (see known issues for explanation why this happens). If this option is selected, after you move the map, the only way to zoom out is to close and open the map again or use 'Quick zoom out'.
